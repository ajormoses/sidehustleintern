-   [My process](#my-process)

1.  We started by looking through the designs to start planning out how i will tackle the project.
2.  Before adding any styles in my css file, we made sure i structure the content in my HTML file. Writing my HTML first helped us to focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
3.  We started adding styles to the top of the page and work down and also i moved on to the next section once i'm satisfied with the area i finished working on.
4.  After working on the structure and design, our last work was to make my design responsive and also to have different design for different screen size using media query.
